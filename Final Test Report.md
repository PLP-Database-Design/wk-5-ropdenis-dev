| Leaderboard | Stores top 3 scores in localStorage |Data Integrity|
| Bonus Round | Every 3 puzzles ‚Üí doubles score |Logic |

## Test Plan

### Objectives

- Verify correctness and stability of new features: Reset Game, Leaderboard (top‚Äë3 persistence), Bonus Round (every 3 puzzles ‚Üí score √ó2).

- Ensure data integrity across sessions (localStorage) and correct score calculation.

- Identify high‚Äërisk defects early and maintain traceability via GitHub Issues.

### Scope

**In Scope:**
- Functional testing of gameplay that is : guess, hint, bonus, reset, leaderboard.
- Risk-based validation for scoring, bonus, and persistence logic.
- UI usability for clarity of bonus and hint feedback.

**Out of Scope:**
- Mobile layout testing beyond basic responsiveness.
- Server-level load testing.

### Tools & Resources

- People: Test Manager, Risk Analyst, Test Executor
- Tools: Chrome , Chrome DevTools GitHub (Issues + Project board), a screen capture tool, Google Sheets for metrics.

## Risk Analysis

### Risks

| ID | Feature | Risk Description | Likelihood | Impact | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
|----|---------|------------------|------------|--------|----------|---------------------|
|R-01 | Leaderboard| Leaderboard fails to persist after refresh or browser close| 1| 3| High| Use localStorage for persistence; add automated test to verify leaderboard remains intact after refresh or reopen.|
|R-02 | Bonus |Bonus score miscalculation | 2| 3| High| Create risk‚Äëbased tests around sequences (e.g., solve 3 puzzles with/without hints) to confirm exact doubling semantics; add unit tests for scoring function.|
|R-03 |Hint system |Hint logic mismatch ‚Äî incorrect deduction : wrong reduced score, Hint button active before puzzle load (causing confusion)|2 | 3| High| Add tests covering hint flow: verify deduction, award value, and ensure Hint is disabled until puzzle is active.|
|R-04 |Reset Function |Bonus counter not resetting after Reset Game | 1 | 2 |Low| Verify Reset to clear the 'Solved' count and Bonus at counter; add test asserting Bonus at: 3 after reset.|
|R-05 |Leadrerboard | Incorrect sorting or tie handling in leaderboard display| 1| 2 | medium |Boundary tests for leaderboard with large integers and ties; ensure numeric sort, stable tie-break (timestamp). |
|R-06 |User Interface |LocalStorage corruption causing missing or broken leaderboard| 1 | 3 |Low | Read-with-validate: wrap localStorage reads in try/catch, validate data structure and types before rendering includes tests that inject malformed entries.|

### Risk Coverage

- Tested Risks Percent:
(5 / 6) √ó 100 = 83%
 
 validated : (2/ 6) √ó 100 = 33%
 
 monitored : (3/ 6) √ó 100 = 50%
- Untested Risks Percent:
  
  Open : (1 / 6) √ó 100 = 17%

### Phases

| Phase | Deliverable | Actual Output | Variance | Owner |
|-------|-------------|---------------|----------|-------|
|Planning & Risk Identification|Test Plan & Risk Analysis | Completed test plan and 6 risks identified| none| Test Manager & Risk Analyst|
|Test Case Design & Environment Setup| Test Case Design & Environment Setup|8 test cases prepared; environment :Chrome, localStorage ready |none | Test Executor & Risk Analyst|
|Test Execution & Defect Logging |Execute Test Cases & Log Defects |4 defects executed (D-01, D-02,Closed D-03 and D-04)|Minor delay for hint usability verification | Test Executor|
|Regression, metrics & report submission| Metrics tables, Risk Coverage, Reflection|Completed metrics & report draft |Minor adjustments needed for TC-03 usability addition | Test Manager & Risk Analyst|

**Progress Tracking Method:**  
- Daily check-ins on GitHub Issues.
- Test case execution tracked in the Test Cases table (Pass/Fail).
- Metrics updated after each test cycle (Defect Density, Risk Coverage, Pass Rate).

**Change Control Notes:**
- Risk R-03 updated to include Hint button usability issues.
- TC-03 added to cover Hint button usability defect.
- D-03 removed as actual behavior matched expected.

## Lessons Learned

- Most Defect Prone Feature: Hint System (multiple issues with deduction timing and button usability).
- Risk Analysis Impact: Risk-based testing helped prioritize Hint and Bonus flows first, preventing major scoring errors.
- Team Communication Effectiveness: Daily GitHub updates and Slack messages improved coordination; minor delays occurred due to clarifying bonus rules.
- Improvements for Next Cycle: 
. Include usability test scenarios earlier.
. Automate leaderboard persistence and bonus calculations verification.
. Improve clarity of scoring rules in test documentation.
